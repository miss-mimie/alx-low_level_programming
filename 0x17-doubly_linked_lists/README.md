A doubly linked list is a type of linked data structure where each node contains three parts:

Data: The actual value or data that the node holds.
Next Pointer: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.
Previous Pointer: A reference (or pointer) to the previous node in the list.
This structure allows traversal of the list in both directions: forward (from head to tail) and backward (from tail to head), unlike singly linked lists which can only be traversed in one direction.

Key Components:
Head: The first node of the list, where the prev pointer is NULL (or None in Python).
Tail: The last node of the list, where the next pointer is NULL (or None in Python).
Next: Pointer/reference to the next node.
Prev: Pointer/reference to the previous node.
Basic Operations on a Doubly Linked List:
Traversal:

Forward Traversal: Start from the head and follow the next pointers to the tail.
Backward Traversal: Start from the tail and follow the prev pointers to the head.
Insertion:

At the Beginning: Insert a node before the head and update the head pointer.
At the End: Insert a node after the tail and update the tail pointer.
In the Middle: Insert a node between two nodes by adjusting the prev and next pointers.
Deletion:

From the Beginning: Remove the head node and update the head pointer.
From the End: Remove the tail node and update the tail pointer.
From the Middle: Remove a node by adjusting the prev and next pointers of the neighboring nodes.
Advantages of Doubly Linked Lists:
Bidirectional Traversal: You can traverse both forward and backward.
Efficient Deletion and Insertion: Deleting or inserting a node (especially in the middle) can be done efficiently since you can easily update both previous and next pointers.
Disadvantages of Doubly Linked Lists:
Extra Memory: Each node requires extra memory for the prev pointer, making it more memory-intensive than singly linked lists.
Complexity: Code can be more complex due to the management of two pointers (next and prev).


Applications of Doubly Linked Lists:
Navigation Systems: Where you need to move forward and backward, like in browsers' history.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Where both forward and backward movements are required.
Implementation of LRU Cache: Doubly linked lists are commonly used in Least Recently Used (LRU) cache implementations.
